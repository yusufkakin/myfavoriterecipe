    <h1>Step by step how to make the Truffle Pizza with Chives and Parmesan!</h1>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Make the pizza dough: Follow the Best Pizza Dough or Thin Crust Dough recipe to prepare the dough. (This takes about 15 minutes to make and 45 minutes to rest.)</li>
        <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your pizza oven (here’s the pizza oven we use).</li>
<li>Prepare the toppings: Slice the mushrooms. Mince the garlic. Chop the chives; set aside a handful of chopped chives for the garnish.</li>
<li>In a saute pan or skillet, heat the 1 tablespoon olive oil to medium high heat. Add the mushrooms, garlic, chives, and ¼ teaspoon kosher salt and cook for about 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until tender and golden brown.</li>
<li>Bake the pizza: When the oven is ready, dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you don’t have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless baking sheet or the back of a rimmed baking sheet. But a pizza peel is well worth the investment!) Stretch the dough into a circle; see How to Stretch Pizza Dough for instructions. Then gently place the dough onto the pizza peel.</li>
<li>Brush a thin layer of olive oil onto the crust. Then top with the mozzarella cheese in an even layer, then the Parmesan cheese and the cooked mushrooms.</li>
<li>Use the pizza peel to carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone. Bake the pizza until the cheese and crust are nicely browned, about 5 to 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in a pizza oven).</li>
<li>Top with the truffle oil to taste*, then top with the reserved chopped chives and a bit of kosher salt or chunky sea salt, crushed with your fingers as you add it. Slice into pieces and serve immediately.</li>
